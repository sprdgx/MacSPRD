## ü§ñ Yazbot: Your Virtual Assistant

 ![](https://github.com/sprdgx/WebGifs/raw/main/Asirem2.gif)

Yazbot is our intelligent chatbot designed to answer any type of questions related to IT and technology. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) using libraries such as `nltk`, `node-nlp`, and `natural`, along with the Wiki API and Axios for fetching data. Yazbot is powered by Vitejs for fast development and Framer Motion for creating engaging animations and interactions. Additionally, it uses Express for server-side functionality and interacts with the file system (`fs`) for data processing. The `node-fetch` module is utilized for making fetch API requests, while `readline` and `readline-sync` enable Yazbot to read and process user input from the terminal.

Yazbot's capabilities are further enhanced by combining these technologies, allowing it to provide accurate and helpful responses to user queries effectively.
